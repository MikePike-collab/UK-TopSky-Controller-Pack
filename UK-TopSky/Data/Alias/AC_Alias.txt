.prc For more info on the basics of VATSIM, please use the plethora of resources available to you to learn http://vats.im/prc is a good start!
.charts Charts for the UK (and other countries) are available for FREE at http://chartfox.org
.ini You've busted the intial altitude of the SID, in future, please refer to the relevant chart and comply with all vertical resticitions of the SID until instructed otherwise. London is a busy area, and compliance with stop altitudes is required to assure separation.
.iniall All pilots are politely reminded that an "inital" altitude may not be given with a clearance. The pilot is still required to comply with all vertical limits of a SID until instructed otherwise. It is important that all pilots review the chart for the SID they are cleared for.
.srd You can find standard UK routings (domestic and to FIR exit points) in the Standard Route Document http://vats.im/srd
.fpl There is no flight plan for your callsign, please file one. I suggest either http://simbrief.com or http://edi-gla.co.uk 
.modec It is a VATSIM CoC requirement (B4) for you to Squawk mode C whilst in the air. Please do so now. If you don't know how to do this, please refer to your pilot client documentation.
.paused You seem to be paused mid-air. It is against the VATSIM CoC (B2). Please resume normal flight or disconnect.
.accel Whilst time acceleration is permitted in uncontrolled airspace, it isn't whilst under control of ATC. Please return to normal simulation rate or disconnect. CoC B9 refers.
.mong The VATSIM CoC (B8) now REQUIRES pilots to be able to comply with ATC Instructions, such as flying headings, speeds and levels. It seems you are unable to comply or are knowingly non-compliant. If you continue, I will simply call a supervisor to remove you from the network.
.mic $aircraft You have an open mic, please check your Push to Talk key/button.
.notme I don't cover that airspace, for a description of the airspace I do cover, visit http://vatsim.uk/area-sectors

UKFIS Explanations
========================================================
.basic You have left controlled airspace. You are now receiving a basic service which offers you maximum autonomy. Airspace activity and traffic information is subject to controller workload. The avoidance of other traffic remains your responsibility.
.traffic You have left controlled airspace. You are now receiving a traffic service which provides detailed traffic information on specific conflicting aircraft. I will not provide you with deconfliction advice regardless of your meteorological conditions.
.deconfliction You have left controlled airspace. You are now receiving a deconfliction service which provides detailed traffic information on specific conflicting aircraft AND advice on how to avoid that aircraft. You remain responsible for collision avoidance; you can opt not to follow the advice.
