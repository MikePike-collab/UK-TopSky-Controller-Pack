Observer Profiles
March 2018

-----------

This folder contains a number of Observer_XXXX.prf files used in the OBSERVING group session
which new controllers are required to attend before receiving local training.
The leaders of these group sessions will refer to these profiles and talk about
its usage in more detail during sessions.

Prior to attending a session, you should check the profile functions correctly:

## Opening Profiles ##

To load profiles, open an instance of EuroScope first (DO NOT navigate
to the profiles and select 'Open With'). 

	If you are not presented with a dialog box and EuroScope loads up and
	presents you with either a blank screen or another profile, click 
	"OTHER SET" on the menu bar and UNCHECK the option: 

	'Auto load last profile on startup'

	Close EuroScope and re-open.

If you are presented with a dialog box asking you to select a profile, 
navigate to the EuroScope\Observer folder on your computer and select
the 'Observer_EGSS.prf' files. The default view is that the Stansted ground map.
You can switch between the Ground and Radar profile by pressing:

Radar: 'F1' then '2'
Ground Map: 'F1' then '1'

## CHECK ##

After loading the profile into EuroScope, please check that your screen matches
the photos provided (OBSPackRadar.png/OBSPackSMR.png). This is to ensure all
settings have loaded correctly.
